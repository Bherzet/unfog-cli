## Contributing

Git commit messages follow the [Angular
Convention](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153), but
contain only a subject.

  > Use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor
  > “changes”<br>Don't capitalize first letter<br>No dot (.) at the end

Code should be as clean as possible, variables and functions use the camel case
convention. A line should never contain more than `80` characters.

Tests should be added for each new functionality. Be sure to run tests before
proposing a pull request.
